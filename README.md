# Machine-Learning

This is a repository of my machine learning models and quantum machine learning experiments. 
My journey through this experience was worth while. I learned more than ever about machine learning by applying and adjusting several parts of the Agent-Enviornment model. I interacted with hyperparamaters, epoches, learning rate, entropy, discount factor, and number of steps before updating policy. I ran about 5 different models. I would have customized them much further but I was limited to only using AWS via mobile web-browser for a majority of the challenge. Even So I was still able to train models and learn from that. The more I played around with the number and the reward function the better my little robo-racer did.
